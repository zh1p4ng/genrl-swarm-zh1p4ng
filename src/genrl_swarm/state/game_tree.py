    Defines a directed game tree with nodes partially ordered by stage/turn of the game.
    Nodes should be nearly self-contained descriptors of (world state, agent action) pairs--they either directly contain or are linked to other nodes required for constructing the state of the world which is needed for the agent to produce the actions stored in the node.
    
    GameTree orchestrates the creation of nodes, populating information within nodes, and management of information across several nodes (e.g., knowing a branch reaches a terminal state)
    GameTree emulates a mapping container type to facilitate calls from the GameManager (through GameState)
    GameTree assumes the set of nodes are IMMUTABLE. Once a node is added it should not be deleted! NOTE: If you choose to do so, then you risk breaking possibly delicate (and vital) causal dependancies in the GameTree.
